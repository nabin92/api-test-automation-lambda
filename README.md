# api-test-automation-lambda
This is an extension of my previous Rest Assured based api automation framework https://github.com/nabin92/api-automation-rest-assured.

This repo shows how to use lambda expressions in Rest Assured tests to avoid Code duplication and write clean code

We have leveraged the below inbuilt functional interfaces:
- Function: The Function Functional Interface represents a function that takes one input and produces an output
- Consumer: The Consumer Functional Interface in represents an operation that takes one input and performs some action

Libraries used remains the same that used in my previous repo https://github.com/nabin92/api-automation-rest-assured
